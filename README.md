# SCVCG
SCVCG (Simple Cpp Voice Chat for Games) is a library written in C++ that you can add to your game (or just an application). 
## It is planned to add:
1. 3D sound.
2. Support for the density of the object to dampen the sound.
3. Pure 2D sound.

### The project is educational, but it would be great if you get inspired to create it and help me.
### Made by Ushakov Igor.
